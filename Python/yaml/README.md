## What is YAML?

[Tutorial sobre YAML](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-yaml-the-yml-file-format/)

YAML stands for YAML Ain't Markup Language, but it originally stood for Yet Another Markup Language.

YAML is a human-readable data serialization language, just like XML and JSON.

Serialization is a process where one application or service that has different data structures and is written in a different set of technologies can transfer data
to another application using a standard format.

In other words, serialization is about translating, converting, and wrapping up a data structure in another format.
