Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container applications.
It is the key to unlocking a streamlined and efficient development and deployment experience.

Compose simplifies the control of your entire application stack, making it easy to manage services,
networks, and volumes in a single, comprehensible YAML configuration file. Then, with a single command,
you create and start all the services from your configuration file.
