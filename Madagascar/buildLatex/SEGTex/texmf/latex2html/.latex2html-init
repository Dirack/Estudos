### Navigation Panel ##########################################################
#
# The navigation panel is constructed out of buttons and section titles.
# These can be configured in any combination with arbitrary text and 
# HTML tags interspersed between them. 
# The buttons available are:
# $PREVIOUS - points to the previous section
# $UP  - points up to the "parent" section
# $NEXT - points to the next section
# $NEXT_GROUP - points to the next "group" section
# $PREVIOUS_GROUP - points to the previous "group" section
# $CONTENTS - points to the contents page if there is one
# $INDEX - points to the index page if there is one
#
# If the corresponding section exists the button will contain an
# active link to that section. If the corresponding section does
# not exist the button will be inactive.
#
# Also for each of the $PREVIOUS $UP $NEXT $NEXT_GROUP and $PREVIOUS_GROUP
# buttons there are equivalent $PREVIOUS_TITLE, $UP_TITLE, etc variables
# which contain the titles of their corresponding sections. 
# Each title is empty if there is no corresponding section.
#
# The subroutine below constructs the navigation panels in each page.
# Feel free to mix and match buttons, titles, your own text, your logos,
# and arbitrary HTML (the "." is the Perl concatenation operator).
